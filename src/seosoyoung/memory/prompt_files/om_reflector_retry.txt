The compressed observations are still too long ({token_count} tokens, \
target is under {target} tokens).

Please compress further:
- Aim for 8/10 detail level — keep essential patterns but be more concise
- Merge similar observations more aggressively
- Remove 🟢 LOW priority items older than 1 week
- Summarize repeated patterns instead of listing each instance
