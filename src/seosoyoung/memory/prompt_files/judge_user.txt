For EACH pending message above, output a `<judgment ts="...">` block with importance, emotion, reasoning, and reaction decision.
IMPORTANT: Only judge messages from the PENDING MESSAGES section. Do NOT create judgment blocks for messages in THREAD CONVERSATIONS or ALREADY JUDGED MESSAGES — those sections are context only.
Do NOT react to messages marked [ALREADY REACTED].
Wrap all judgments in `<judgments>...</judgments>`.
